# Target_Business_Case_Study-SQL-
This SQL-based business case offers a comprehensive analysis of various key performance metrics for an e-commerce company operating in Brazil, focusing on customer orders, logistics, and trends over time. Here are the key elements addressed in the case and the insights gained:

1. Customer and Order Data Overview
Data types of columns: Extracting column data types from the customers table helps understand the structure of the data, ensuring that appropriate queries and transformations are used.
Time range of orders: Orders were placed between September 4, 2016, and October 17, 2018, providing the timeframe for the analysis.
Geographic distribution: Customers from 27 states and 4,119 cities participated, indicating a wide geographic reach.
2. Trends and Seasonality in Orders
Annual growth: A substantial rise in orders from 2016 to 2017 (~20%), reflecting increasing customer engagement.
Monthly seasonality: Peak ordering periods were observed in November 2017 and January 2018, suggesting strong seasonality around the holidays.
Order timing: Most orders were placed in the afternoon (13:00-18:00), recommending resource adjustments for customer support during these peak hours.
3. Regional Trends
State-level order distribution: São Paulo consistently leads in order volume, requiring special focus in terms of logistics and inventory management.
State distribution of customers: São Paulo dominates, with more customers than the next six states combined, emphasizing the importance of the state in business strategy.
4. Order Value and Freight Costs
Yearly cost increase: There was a 136.98% increase in the value of orders from 2017 to 2018, indicating strong revenue growth during this period.
Order and freight values by state: São Paulo leads in both total and average order value, as well as freight costs, suggesting that resource allocation and logistics strategies should prioritize this state.
Freight value distribution: Higher freight costs in Northern states highlight regional logistical challenges.
5. Delivery Times and Efficiency
Delivery times: Extended delivery times, with over 60 orders taking more than 100 days, indicate significant logistical issues.
Average delivery times by state: Northern states, such as Roraima and Amapá, face the longest delivery times due to geographic challenges, while more urbanized states like São Paulo have shorter times.
Order delivery vs. estimated dates: Identifying states with faster-than-expected delivery times helps pinpoint efficient logistics operations that could serve as models for improvement in other regions.
Recommendations Based on Insights
Inventory and logistics management: Increase resources during peak months (November and January), especially in São Paulo, to handle higher demand.
Regionalized logistics: Tailor delivery strategies to the challenges of Northern regions and improve infrastructure (e.g., local distribution centers).
Customer support: Boost support during peak ordering times in the afternoon to enhance customer satisfaction.
Operational efficiency: Address bottlenecks causing extended delivery times, and implement automation and predictive models to manage logistics effectively.
This case highlights the value of using SQL queries to extract actionable business insights, optimizing resources, and enhancing customer satisfaction through data-driven decision-making.
